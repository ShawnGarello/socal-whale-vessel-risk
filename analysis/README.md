# Analysis

This directory is the Python package for the M3 offline-processing foundation.
It currently provides a runnable command-line boundary and the reproducible
toolchain that later retrieval, whale-processing, grid/water, and
vessel-aggregation work will use. It does not yet retrieve data, produce
derived datasets, calculate relative exposure, or report inside-versus-outside
statistics.

Run all commands below from this directory.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 (the package requires `>=3.13,<3.14`)
- uv 0.12 or later, available in this repository as `python -m uv`

## Setup and checks

```text
python -m uv sync --locked
python -m uv lock --check
python -m uv run ruff format .
python -m uv run ruff format --check .
python -m uv run ruff check .
python -m uv run mypy src/whale_vessel_analysis
python -m uv run pytest
python -m uv build
python -m uv run python -m whale_vessel_analysis --help
```

`uv.lock` is committed. `uv sync --locked` creates an ignored local virtual
environment from that lock and fails instead of changing it. Runtime packages
belong in `project.dependencies`; test, lint, and type-check tools belong in the
`dev` dependency group.

## Re-running the large-tabular benchmark

The benchmark supporting the primary-engine decision is parameterized; no
sample path or output path is built into it. Supply an AIS CSV with the exact
published header:

```text
python -m uv run python -m whale_vessel_analysis.benchmark --input <ais-csv> --runs 5
```

The command reads only the supplied file and writes a JSON report to standard
output. It runs DuckDB and Polars in separate processes, samples process RSS,
and fails unless their grouped results are equivalent. Polars and psutil are
benchmark-group dependencies; Polars is not a production dependency.
